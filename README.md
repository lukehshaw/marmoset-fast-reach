# marmoset-fast-reach
These functions perform analyses and generate figures for the reaching 
population analyses found in 'Fast prediction in marmoset reach-to-grasp movements for dynamic prey'
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.08.511417v2 Currently in review at Current Biology.

Run master_mfr.m to run all functions.

grasp_cluster_mfr requires marmo_grasp_model.mat
all other scripts require marmo_reach_model.mat

pre-analyzed structures are available for pursuit_model_pred_delay and regression_model, which are
reachsim_pred_delay.mat and marm_regress_1.mat, respectively.

Reaching data structure marmo_reach_model.mat available in this repo and at
